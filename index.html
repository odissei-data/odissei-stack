<h1>Collection of metadata from CBS Microdata in the ODISSEI Portal</h1>
<p>The ODISSEI portal (currently as a prototype available on <a href="https://odissei-data.github.io/">https://odissei-data.github.io/</a>), provides an overview of microdata from CBS that researchers may access under strict conditions.</p>
<p>This page provides information about the ODISSEI portal and the metadata of the CBS microdata that is included in the portal.</p>

<h3>ODISSEI Portal</h3>
<p>ODISSEI (Open Data Infrastructure for Social Science and Economic Innovations) is the national research infrastructure for the social sciences in the Netherlands (<a href="https://odissei-data.nl/">https://odissei-data.nl/</a>). As part of the ODISSEI roadmap project, we are developing a metadata portal through which relevant information on social science studies in the Netherlands can be discovered.</p>
<p>In the ODISSEI Portal, researchers can - amongst others - find information about microdata available at Statistics Netherlands (CBS). </p>

<h3>CBS Microdata</h3>
<p>Statistics Netherlands (CBS) conducts statistical research on behalf of the Dutch government for practice, policy and science purposes; and to publish the statistics compiled on the basis of this research. CBS has an enormous amount of statistical data available. This includes anonymized, aggregated data that can be accessed free of charge on <a href="https://cbs.nl">cbs.nl</a> and <a href="https://opendata.cbs.nl/#/CBS/nl/">StatLine</a>. If researchers are interested in data at the level of individuals they may also be able to request access to the microdata available at CBS. </p>

<p><em>More information about the process of working with microdata is available <a href="https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/onze-diensten/customised-services-microdata/microdata-conducting-your-own-research">CBS Microdata</a>.</em></p>
